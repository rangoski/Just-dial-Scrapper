# Just-dial-Scrapper

So recently i was searching for a justdial scrapper and i didn't found any so i got irritated and made one.

How to use ->

1.Open the Url which you want to scrape like this -> https://www.justdial.com/Indore/Employment-Agencies/nct-10187839
2.Open console and copy paste the Javascript code on console.
3. Once you are able to see all the listed leads on website run this function on console -> extractDetails("filename") 
4.Done. (you can replace filename from the name of file you want). You can see a CSV file getting downloaded.
